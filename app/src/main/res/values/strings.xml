        \t\tThe BEEMO-Development of Automated Beehive
        Monitoring System is a device that will be able to monitor
        the health status of the bees, through monitoring the inside
        and outside temperature and relative humidity of the hive,
        plus the weight which depends on the beehive. In addition,
        the BEEMO can be used for the research on stingless bees
        to determine the absolute value of temperature, humidity
        and weight using the sensors located on the device. It also
        allows the beekeepers/users to remotely monitor honey
        accumulation in the beehives by determining the weight
        produced by the bees. The data from the hives reaches
        phone application through the cellular and internet
        networks. A SMS alert will also serve as notification
        whenever the user is not connected on the internet. The
        data on the graph collected from the system enables the
        beekeepers to understand precisely what is happening on
        the hive and bees. With the information receive from the
        system, beekeepers can react instantly and accurately
        making optimal decision for the hives.
